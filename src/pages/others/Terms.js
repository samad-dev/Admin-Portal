    CASANTEY’s Privacy Commitment

    CASANTEY has worried about customer and user privacy for almost 20 years,
    long before it became fashionable, politically correct, or legally binding
    to take such a position. We ask for only the least amount of information
    necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential for doing business,
    or for the specific transaction at hand. We let customers know the
    information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific
    engagements. But, by far, our biggest commitment is that we do not make a
    single dollar from advertising revenue—never have, never will—even from the
    free editions of our products. This means we avoid the fundamental conflict
    of interest between gathering customer information and fueling advertising
    revenue, and the unavoidable compromises in customer privacy that it brings.
  </p>
  <p style={{ textIndent: "0pt", textAlign: "left" }}>
    <br />
  </p>
  <p style={{ paddingLeft: "22pt", textIndent: "0pt", textAlign: "justify" }}>
    The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our
    customers and users, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is
    unfortunately longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address
    all the relevant cases. We will try and keep the language simple and direct
    as much as possible.
